"""ASS5 PROG1:
 Program 1: PUP Grading System
# Section 8 of https://www.pup.edu.ph/studentservices/files/ThePUPStudentHandbook2014.pdf
# Create a program that will ask for grade percentage.
# Display the equivalent Grade/Mark and Description
# Example:
# Input grade: 87.6
# Grade/Mark: 1.75
# Description: Very Good"""

#Ass5 Prog1, 1st try,   using roundfunc (baka mamali kapag .5 ang deci ng input)
#            2nd try,   changed roundfunc - since hindi round up lagi pag 0.5 (rounding to nearest even number sya kapag 0.5 sa roundfunc)
#                       added input check with tryagain/exit option if invalid input
